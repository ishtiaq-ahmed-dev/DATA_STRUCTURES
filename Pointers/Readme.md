### 3. Sports Score Tracker (`sports score tracker.cpp`):contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Description:**  
Records and displays runs scored by each player.  
- **Concepts Used:**  
- Dynamic memory allocation using `malloc`  
- Arrays and loops  
- **Sample Input/Output:**  


Enter the Total Players participating: 3
