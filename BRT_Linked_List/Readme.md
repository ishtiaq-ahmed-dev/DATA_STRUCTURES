# 🚌 Passenger Queue Management using Linked List  

This program implements a **dynamic queue system for passengers** using a **singly linked list** in C++.  
It demonstrates key **Data Structure operations** such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.  

---

## 📌 Features  

- **Insert at Beginning** → Adds a new passenger at the front of the queue.  
- **Insert at End** → Adds a passenger at the rear of the queue.  
- **Insert at Position** → Inserts a passenger at a specific position in the queue.  
- **Delete from Beginning** → Removes the first passenger from the queue.  
- **Print Queue** → Displays all passengers in order.  

---

## 🛠 Code Explanation  

### 🔹 Struct: `Node`  
Each passenger is represented as a **node** containing:  
- `Passenger_ID` → Unique identifier  
- `next` → Pointer to the next passenger  

### 🔹 Class: `LinkedList`  
Implements the core queue logic with methods:  
- `insert_at_beginning(int ID)`  
- `insert_at_end(int ID)`  
- `insert_at_position(int ID, int position)`  
- `delete_from_beginning()`  
- `print()`

## ▶️ Example Execution  

```text
Queue: 101 -> 102 -> 103 -> 
Queue: 999 -> 101 -> 102 -> 103 -> 
Queue: 999 -> 101 -> 555 -> 102 -> 103 -> 
Queue: 101 -> 555 -> 102 -> 103 ->


🚀 How to Run

Save the file as passenger_queue.cpp

Compile the program:

g++ brt_linkedlist.cpp -o queue
./queue


🎯 Learning Outcomes

Understanding of Linked List implementation in C++

Practical application of queue-like behavior

Mastery of dynamic memory allocation (new & delete)

Use of insertion and deletion operations
